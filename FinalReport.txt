Customer Churn Prediction - Final Report
1. Introduction
In this project, we aim to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company based on customer data. Churn prediction is important for businesses to understand why customers leave and to take preventive actions to retain them.

Problem Statement:
The primary objective of this project is to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the company) or not, based on various features such as customer demographics, service usage, and contract details.

2. Data Preprocessing
The dataset contains various features related to customer information, such as demographic details, service usage, and customer behavior.

Data Cleaning:
Missing values: Missing data in columns like Total Charges was handled by converting the column to numeric values and filling missing entries with the mean.

Categorical Features: Categorical features like Gender, Partner, Dependents, and Churn Reason were encoded using Label Encoding. This converts non-numeric values into numeric representations for machine learning models.

Scaling: Numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure that all features have the same scale and help improve the performance of the models.

3. Model Building
Two machine learning models were used to predict customer churn:

Logistic Regression:
Logistic Regression is a statistical model that predicts the probability of a binary outcome (churn or not churn).

The model was trained using the features in the dataset, and the accuracy of the model was evaluated using a test set.

Accuracy of the Logistic Regression model: 100%.

Random Forest:
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions.

The model was trained with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters.

Best Parameters found:

max_depth: 10

min_samples_split: 2

n_estimators: 100

Accuracy of the Random Forest model: 100%.

4. Model Evaluation
Confusion Matrix:
The confusion matrix was used to evaluate the performance of both models. Both models achieved a perfect classification with no false positives or false negatives.

Logistic Regression:

Accuracy: 100%

Precision: 100%

Recall: 100%

F1-Score: 100%

Random Forest:

Accuracy: 100%

Precision: 100%

Recall: 100%

F1-Score: 100%

5. Conclusion
Both Logistic Regression and Random Forest models performed exceptionally well, achieving an accuracy of 100%. This indicates that the models were able to perfectly classify the churn and non-churn customers based on the given features.

Further Improvements:
Advanced Models: Trying more advanced models like Support Vector Machines or Gradient Boosting could improve predictions further.

Feature Engineering: Additional features or new data sources could be used to enhance model performance.

Deep Learning: Implementing neural networks for churn prediction could be explored as a future step.

The project successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms for customer churn prediction and highlights the importance of accurate predictions for business decision-making.
